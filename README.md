# Setup

1. npm install
2. npm start
3. go to localhost on your web browser
4. Press F12 and make it a mobile sized

# Updates need to be work on

1. Keyboard input, its not working normally like it should be very easy to get out and use and un use keyboard see whats the lag about, I think you need to use specific react native syntax

2. Add expense page dont have a back button

3. let implement Unique Key per User method and change the data storage solution, we will even add logic to create the key and that will be add start from user_id:1 or add 1 to that last user_id

# start url http://localhost:8081?id=1


#Logic is written for expense part just have to make an exception that the user cannot enter the expense amount to be zero. as in Asynstorage it is defining it as null which destroys the app.
#Have to write logic for graph and top expenses.
